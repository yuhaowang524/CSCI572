Our data has shown that DuckDuckGo and Google produce different search results over the same search query. Those search result have a low number of overlapping on average, which is about 1.8 per 10 input (or average percent overlap: 18%). Also, the overlapping results yield a negative Spearmanâ€™s correlation coefficient of -7.6 on average, meaning those search results are dissimilar. Therefore, DuckDuckGo and Google reproduce search results with low relevancy for each query and adapt different ranking algorithm for those output as well.
